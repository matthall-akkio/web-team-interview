# Akkio Web Team live coding exercise

Your task is to implement this user interface component. Please note the following:

- We aren’t too worried about being pixel-perfect here, but please follow the general layout and borders/border radius/font weight.
- We’ve provided a JSON object that represents the API result. No loading state is required.

Please implement your solution in `src/`, starting with `src/App.vue`.
